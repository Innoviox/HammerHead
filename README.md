# HammerHead
An algorithm for Scrabble, the classic word game. A basic computer player can play against you, or you can just play against a friend.
Please note that this game needs python 3.4.2 and Tcl/TK at least 8.6.4 because of some unicode errors that may occur. The diphthin program helps the speed. The scrabble program will automatically run it for you if you haven't run it before you run the scrabble program.
